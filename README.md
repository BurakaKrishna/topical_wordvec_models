# topical_wordvec_models

You first need to create a save folder for training. Also, you have to download the [saved model](https://topicvecmodels.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/save/47/model) and place it in ./save/47/ to run the trained model. You can directly download the [wordvecs](https://topicvecmodels.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/save/47/aggrd_all_wordrep.txt).
